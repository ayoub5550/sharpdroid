# **it does not touch a device.** producing a build and putting one on a phone are two jobs, which is
# what lets a build packaged last week -- or one somebody else packaged -- be staged without
# republishing anything.
#
# **`--from-archive` needs no fork checkout, no .NET SDK and no git.** that is the path a third party
# takes and the one any automated job would take. what it cannot do is record a commit, so the
# build's `commit` is empty and its `source` names the archive instead -- and with no fork there is
# no remote to take an author from, so `--author` is how one is set there.
#
# **everything else defaults from the fork**: the id and the `source` from the branch, the author
# from the owner of that branch's `origin` remote, and the display name from the table below where
# there is one for it.
#
# **a build is a directory, not a file.** the publish output is the payload *and* its plugins, which
# the payload resolves relative to its own executable -- both for its managed plugins and for the
# media libraries behind video. packaging the payload alone is a build with no audio and no video.
#
# **identity lives in the metadata and never in a filename.** the folder a build lands in on a device
# is derived from it, so two builds of the same source coexist and nothing has to guess which is
# which.
#
# **the zip is the distribution format and the directory is what runs.** both are produced here, so
# the format is exercised by the thing that produces it.

# is what keeps absorbing an upstream release a thing you do once.
#
# **a topic branch says which base it sits on, and the android one says so explicitly.**
# `<type>/android/<topic>` carries the platform support underneath the change, so it builds an APK
# and is what a measurement runs; `<type>/<topic>` is upstream plus the change and nothing else,
