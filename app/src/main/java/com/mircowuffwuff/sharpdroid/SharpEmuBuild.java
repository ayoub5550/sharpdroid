/**
 * a SharpEmu build: a directory holding a payload, its {@code plugins/}, and a {@code meta.json}
 * that gives it an identity.
 *
 * <p><b>a build is a directory, not a file.</b> SharpEmu resolves {@code plugins/} relative to its
 * own executable -- {@code AppContext.BaseDirectory/plugins} for managed plugins and
 * {@code ffmpeg.RootPath} for the Bink decoder -- so a payload staged on its own is a payload with
 * no audio and no video. the host layer needs no part of this: {@code GuestProcFS::SetExe} is
 * {@code realpath} of the payload path it is handed, so {@code AppContext.BaseDirectory} follows
 * the build directory by itself.
 *
 * <p>everything here is the launcher's job on purpose. the host layer keeps taking a payload path
 * and stays a thing that runs an ELF; name resolution, {@code meta.json} and the contract check
 * live where the frontend's own build list will need them anyway, because two implementations of
 * one contract is one too many.

     * ports per read, and the whole of the emulator's pad state.

     * {@code backend=silent}: the game renders and makes no sound. a contract-2 payload does not know
     * {@code SHARPEMU_HOST_INPUT}, so it registers no input source and its pad exports report a
     * controller that is permanently connected and permanently neutral. the launch log names the
     * generation that ran, which is where either is found.
     *
     * <p><b>the host layer answers the contract 3 pad format as well as the contract 4 one, and this
