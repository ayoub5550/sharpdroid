// sharpdroid host layer -- guest x86-64 vulkan onto the host's arm64 vulkan, in-process.
//
// this is route B's central claim made concrete: the guest's vulkan calls do not cross a socket,
// a process boundary or a protocol. they arrive here, and here calls the real driver on the same
// thread, in the same address space, one host call later.
//
// the trap is a syscall with a magic number. the guest side is a generated shared object,
// host/thunks/vulkan/generated/vulkan_stubs.S built into libvulkan.so.1, where every entry point is the
// same 16 bytes but for one immediate:
//
//     movq %rcx, %r10           ; the syscall instruction destroys RCX, which holds C arg 3
//     movl $0x564B00nn, %eax    ; "VK" << 16 | command id
//     syscall
//     ret
//
// a syscall rather than an illegal instruction or a call gate because the host layer already
// owns that boundary: FEXCore spills the *entire* guest state, GPRs and FPRs alike, before every
// syscall (JIT/BranchOps.cpp DEF_OP(Syscall), GPRSpillMask = FPRSpillMask = ~0U), so CPUState is
// a complete and exact description of the guest's registers at the call. that is what lets one
// stub shape serve 623 entry points with different signatures: the *host* reads the arguments
// out of the spilled state according to the SysV classification, so no stub ever has to know
// anything about its own prototype.
//
// two things make this far smaller than a general FFI:
//
//   - **no pointer translation at all.** guest and host share one address space 1:1, so a guest
//     pointer is already a host pointer. every VkStructure the guest fills in is read by the
//     driver in place. this is the single biggest thing route B buys and it is why the whole
//     marshaller is one template rather than a code generator per struct.
//   - **vulkan passes nothing by value that is not a scalar.** every command takes handles,
//     enums, integers, floats and pointers, and returns void or an integer. so argument
//     classification collapses to "SSE if floating point, INTEGER otherwise" and the return
//     value is always RAX. ArgReader static_asserts this, so a future header that breaks it is
//     a compile error rather than silent corruption.
//
// what the host must *not* pass through is anything that would make the driver call back into
// guest code, since a guest function pointer is x86-64 and the driver would enter it as arm64:
//   - VkAllocationCallbacks* is forced to nullptr, by a type-level specialisation, so all ~90
//     commands taking one are covered without naming any of them.
//   - vkGetInstanceProcAddr/vkGetDeviceProcAddr return the *guest* stub address, not the host
//     function. SharpEmu's presenter casts what GetDeviceProcAddr returns straight to a
//     delegate* and calls it, so this is load-bearing rather than tidy.
